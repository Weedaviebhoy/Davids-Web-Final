    <h2> Official Football (Soccer in America) Website</h2>

    <p>Football is by far the greatest sport on Earth in its history. A sport played and watched by literally billions of individuals.
        And billions is no exaggeration. At the 2022 world Cup final, the final alone had over 2 billion live viewers.
        Thats the equivalent of 10 Super Bowls. But that is not the only reason for such passion. This passion comes from years of
        playing and watching the game. Watching and participating in real life art and magic as the ball and the player
        dances around the field in synchronization. This love stems from my father being from Europe and introducing me to this sport
        at a young age. This led to supporting a team from Glasgow, Scotland. The Celtic Football Club. They are a football powerhouse
        in Scotland, owning the most league titles and trophies in Scotland, and the first team in all of Britain to win the European Cup.
        The most prestigeous trophy in European Football.
